# Reinforcement_Learning
A repository for my MA4K8 Mathematics in Action project. The Python notebook in this directory provides the code to train models on Gymnasium's Box2D Car Racing environment, using the Proximal Policy Optimisation (PPO) algorithm. The resultant models, named according to their training steps, are provided in the other folders of this repository.
