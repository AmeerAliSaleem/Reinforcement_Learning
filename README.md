# Reinforcement_Learning
A repository for my MA4K8 Mathematics in Action project. The Python notebook in this directory provides the code to train models on Gymnasium's Box2D Car Racing environment, using the Proximal Policy Optimisation (PPO) algorithm. The resultant models, named according to their training steps, are provided in the other folders of this repository.

The '____ iterations model' folders contains the files needed to witness the individual drivers in action. These can be viewed by passing the correct directory into the Python notebook.

The 'Logs' folder contains the Tensorboard plots for two main models discussed in the report. To view the performance metrics, ensure that TensorFlow is installed, then run the line `tensorboard --logdir={directory_name}` in the command prompt, with the correct directory name substituted into the command.
